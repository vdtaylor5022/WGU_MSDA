    "***Research Question***\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question I want to answer for this analysis is what features contribute most to a customer churn? The question itself is fairly broad, however I believe it is the most important question we need to answer in terms of remaining a going concern in the telecom landscape. A piece from the CFA Institute goes on to define churn as *\"Customer churn rate (also known as customer attrition rate) measures the proportion of contractual customers of a company who cease their subscriptions over a defined time period.\"* As I have discussed in prior write-ups the cost to acquire a customer is more expensive than it is to maintin an already existing customer. The benefits associated with this analysis are as follows; being able to indentify key aspects that contribute to customer churn will allow for the creation of strategies that can be implemented in order to mitigate the amount of customers choosing to churn. This can lead to a direct cost savings by not having to focuse as heavily on marketing to new customers. Another benefit associated for the company would be the competitve advantage that is created by using data in order to inform insights. I will answer this question using k-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives and Goals for this analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal for this particular analysis is to be able to determine when a customer is likely to churn similar d208 task 2 we want to build a model that will help us predict the likelihood of churn and I would also like to see if we could get the accuracy of our model to be more accurate than the model we created in task 2 for D208. If the model is not able to predict churn more accurately than the logistic model, I would accept an accuracy greater than 70%. Based on the amount of predictor/independent variables we have in this dataset that we could use to aid with our prediction of churn. We will also need to check to see if there are more instances of churn than not churn and potentially using techniques like oversampling to ensure that the predictions of the model don't show bias. We want to create a model that would be something that we could easily deploy to make predictions on unseen data.\n",

    "## Part II Method Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "***Justificaton of Method***\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task I will be using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). KNN is useful in both classification and regression. Datacamp describes KNN as a \"voting system\" in which the majority class label determines the class label of a new data point among it's nearest k neighbors in the feature space. I chose to use KNN for this task due to it being the most widely used for classification problems in the industry. My interpretation I got out of it was that it is an algorithm that stores all cases of a particular instance or variable and when new data is added it classifies it based on its similarity to variables it has seen. KNN is also easily interperatable and is easy to implement. KNN also does not require a training phase for data. Some cons associated with KNN with are it is extremely intensive on computer memory as it stores the entire training dataset, this can lead to the speed of predictions taking some time due to its need to compute distances and find neighbors within each data point. KNN is also extremely sensitive to outliers and we can see distored calculations influence predictions negatively. Lastly KNN would not perform well on high dimensonal data outputs where the number of features is similar to the number of or greater than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Assumption of Classification Method***\n",
    "\n",
    "One assumption of KNN is that the closer two points are together the more related they are, this is known as the local smoothness assumption. KNN uses distance measures to calculate proximity between datapoints the measures include; Manhattan and Euclidean distances or cosine similarity. We can also use visualization techniques such as PCA or scatter plots to see the proximity of features. \n",

    "***Package/Libarary Selection**\n",

    "I chose to use Python to perform this analysis due to its ability to handle data analysis as well as it's ease of use when it comes to visualizing and performing statitsitcal modeling. I will also be using various packages in order to perform this analysis.\n",

I will also be using features identified in d208 task 2 for this classification model, with the goal of 70% accuracy at  minimum. \n",

    "\n",
    "The model is accurate around 75% of the time which is a little worse than what the logisitic model I had created in D208 was at 77%. The data itself is a bit skewed with only 22% of the customer base actually churning. I believe that if we had more cases of churn the model would be able to increase it's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AUC score of 0.73 shows that the model has a fairly high chance of being able to predict churn, but I still would not trust this level of accuracy enough in order to implement this in a production environment. For reference an AUC = 1 would be a 100% accurate model meaning it is able to correctly distinguish churn from no churn and an AUC score of <=0.5 would mean that it is not able to distinguish a churn from a no churn and would definitely not be suitable for a production enviornment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (E2) Classification Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the AUC score of our model being between 0.5 and 1 means that it is better than random guessing but not completely accurate. The model is accurate in predicting churn around 75% of the time which is less than that of the logistic regression model I found it a bit dissapointing based on my hope of being able to tie specific features to the likelihood of customer churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (E3) Limitations of analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential limitation of this analysis is that I used the default distance metric which was Euclidean distance when performing the classification. Had I chosen another distance metric the results may have been a more suitable choice and increased accuracy. Another limitation as previously discussed in my prior PAs is that we don't have enough domain knowledge in order to determine if a client is a true churn. For example a client may opt to select another provider for streaming_tv or streaming_movies but retain our fiber optic internet service. We would need further detail in order to even consider this model as useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (E4) Recommended Course of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation based on this analysis would be to have a call with internal stakeholders and let them know the results of what the KNN classification and potentially seeing if I could get more domain knowledge to ensure I am understanding what's needed in order to create a useful model. Then making a recommendation that we should potentially look at bundling services that show a high-churn rate. I believe this would be beneficial as we could use certain features as \"loss leaders\" in order to maintain more long-term customers and keeping maintaining them on higher cost products such as phone and internet.\n",
