    "\n",
    "***Research Question***\n",
    "\n",
    "(A1): The research question that I will be analyzing is what factors  contribute most to `tenure`. This question is the same from my D208 assessment as I believe that delving deeper into this specific question would create value for our organization. The benefits associated with this analysis are being able to understand factors that contribute to customer tenure. By finding the factors that contribute we can then potentially identify specific products or create incentives in order to maintain more long-term customers. As previously discussed in my prior markup finding attributes that predict tenure can lead to a direct cost savings by not having to focus as heavily on marketing to new customers. I will answer this question using decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives and Goals for this analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using DecisionTreeRegressor from the sklearn library, the primary objective of this analysis is to look into the variables that could affect a customer's tenure. Our main goal will be to identify the dataset's most significant characteristics that may have an influence on tenure. For this reason, we are going to utilize the same set of features that were included in the original d208 MLR model for task1.These variables will then be preprocessed to fit our decision tree regression model. Our ultimate goal is to identify potential customer churning points and facilitate proactive customer service actions. Using predictive modeling helps strengthen our customer service and helps us target potential churners and tailor products and services to keep customers long term. In addition, by recognizing these important factors, we can more effectively allocate funds and resources, strengthening our position as industry leaders.\n",

    "## Part II Method Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "***Justificaton of Method***\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task I will be using decisions trees. I chose this method due to its ease and convience of being able to visulaize results and the fact it is more easy to interpret. Decision trees may also be used with both numerical and categorical data. What makes decision trees different from the random forest is that decision trees themselves are graphs that show all of the potential outcomes of a decision using the branches to represent different paths. Another reason I chose this compared to the random forest method is that the final model for a decision tree can be visualized. A downside to decision trees is that it is prone to overfitting,and innacurate final results. Due to this a random forest may be a more suitable choice due to it being able to avoid overfitting by using multiple trees, another downside is that in most real world cases the better method to use would be the random forest algorithm due to modern computers being able to handle larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "***How Decision Trees Work***\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees use multiple algorithms to decide where to split a node into, esentially a step by step process until we can arrive at answer we are looking for. For example we are trying to predict customer tenure, the tree starts by taking all of the features we have such \"does a customer have online_security? How much bandwidth do they use? etc, and based on the all the different types of responses it creates a new branch until you reach the specific leaf that tells you the answer. Furthermore Analytics Vidhya goes on to describe the way decision trees work through recursive partitioning where each node is divided into child nodes and the process continues until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Assumption of Classification Method***\n",
    "\n",
    "One assumption of decision tree models is that, there is an assumption of independence among features. This means that the model treats each feature seperately when making decisions. Analytics Vidhya goes on to state that this may not actually hold to be true in actual cases as a decision tree can perform well even if the features show high correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Package/Libarary Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to use Python to perform this analysis due to its ability to handle data analysis as well as it's ease of use when it comes to visualizing and performing statitsitcal modeling. I will also be using various packages in order to perform this analysis.\n",

    "> The code I've built takes a structured approach to optimize the DecisionTreeRegressor model. Initially, I chose a range of hyperparameters, such as 'max_depth' and 'min_samples_leaf', to explore variations in tree depth and leaf node sample requirements. I then used GridSearchCV in order to identify the optimal set that maximizes the model's predictive performance.\n",

    "> After hyperparameter tuning, I used best_estimator to find the best model fit. best_estimator takes the highest R-squared score during cross-validation. After that, I utilize the 'best_model' to predict customer tenure on the test set, allowing me to assess its predictive accuracy. Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are computed to quantify the model's precision. Using this approach optimizes the decision tree's structure but also ensures the selection of the best parameters, which builds the model's predictive capability on unseen data."

    "\n",
    "The test set's MSE (Mean Squared Error) of 7.700 shows that the model's prediction error rate is extremely low. Lower values indicate better accuracy. Moreover the MSE of 7.700 shows that the squared differences between actual and predicted values are very low. I would also need more domain knowledge of the industry as a whole to decide wether this score is high or low, but in this context I am viewing it as low.\n",

Furthermore a score of 98% indicates that our model explains a majority the variability of the response data around its mean. However based on the decision trees having an overfitting risk I am also hesitant to accept the result right away and would probably recommend more testing before implementing into a production environment, until I am sure I could replicate the results on unseen data.\n",

    "One limitation of the data analysis is the as previously discussed is overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns specific patterns in the training data to the point that it performs very well on the training set but struggles to generalize to new, unseen data. This could be a concern if the model's high performance is solely due to overfitting or noise present in the training data, rather than capturing genuine relationships. \n",

    "My recommendation on this analysis would be to validate the model's performance on an unseen dataset, potentially an industry competitor or if we are able to pull historical data, validating the performance against historicals. If the model maintains high accuracy and generalizability across different datasets, it shoud further be implemented into a production environment.\n",
